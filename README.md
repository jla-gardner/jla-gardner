I’m interested in using Machine Learning 🤖 \
to learn the rules of Quantum Mechanics ⚡️ \
and simulate amorphous chemical systems 🧪


I wrote and maintain the following repositories:

> **[🕸️ graph-pes](https://github.com/jla-gardner/graph-pes)**\
> train and use graph-based ML models of potential energy surfaces

> **[⚛️ load-atoms](https://jla-gardner.github.io/load-atoms/)**\
> a python package for downloading and manipulating **L**arge **O**pen **A**ccess **D**atasets for **Ato**mistic **M**aterials **S**cience

> **[💿 locache](https://github.com/jla-gardner/local-cache)**\
> a python package for persisting function calls to disk

> **[🔬 digital-experiments](https://jla-gardner.github.io/digital-experiments/)**\
> a lightweight tool for recording and automating coding experiments and their configuration
