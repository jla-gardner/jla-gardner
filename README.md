I’m interested in using Machine Learning 🤖 to learn the rules of Quantum Mechanics ⚡️ to simulate Amorphous Inorganic Systems 🧪

I wrote and maintain the following repositories:
- [💿 locache](https://github.com/jla-gardner/local-cache) - a python package for persisting function calls to disk
- [💻 digital-experiments](https://github.com/jla-gardner/digital_experiments) - a python package for keeping track of and optmizing configuration for digital scientific experiments
