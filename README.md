I’m interested in using Machine Learning 🤖 to learn the rules of Quantum Mechanics ⚡️ and applying this in simulating Amorphous Inorganic Systems 🧪

Find me [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=797Gg3sAAAAJ&hl=en) on Google Scholar!

I wrote and maintain the following repositories:
- [💿 locache](https://github.com/jla-gardner/local-cache) - a python package for persisting function calls to disk
- [⚛️ load-atoms](https://jla-gardner.github.io/load-atoms/) - a python package for downloading and manipulating Large Open Access Datasets for Atomistic Materials Science
